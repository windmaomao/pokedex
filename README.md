# Pokedex clone

A website similar to [pokedex](pokemon.com/us/pokedex).

It allows you to search pokemon by name or id. And it also saves your search history for revisit.

```
  yarn start
  yarn test
```

## Notes

Since there's requirement for redux+typescript, I started with the following template.

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript
```
